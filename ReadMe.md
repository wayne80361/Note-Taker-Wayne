## Description [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

- What was your motivation?

      To build a note taker app for small business owner.

- Why did you build this project?

      For the convience of a user to take notes with electronic devices and have access on the cloud instead of writing on a physical notebook.

- What problem does it solve?

      A user can easily add and save notes, and delete a note and access it with internet connection if one wishes.

- What did you learn?

      express npm, routes, heroku.
      helpers functions are great.
      delete require to read file first, find index then delete it from array, and finally write the whole other notes back to the file. It will not be efficient if writing to a big database. It needs to run the read-all and write-all behavior.
